#What is this?

This will eventually be a web-based gratitude journal. It will allow for user registration, logon, and will allow users to write, save, and review journal entries.

#Why am I doing this?

The primary purpose of this project is to learn node.js, express.js, and react.js.

#How can I run this?

Currently, you will be unable to run this, as it doesn't have a variables.env file, nor do I include the table schema (though you can probably infer it from the code). Eventually, I'll put a blank file up as a template (once I get a little further in the project).
